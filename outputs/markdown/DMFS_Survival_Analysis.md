# DMFS Survival Analysis 
- Data is based on the BC2116 dataset
- Fn14 mRNA expression tertiles were recalculated after subsetting the data based on either ER, PR, or HR status. 
- A few extra subsets were included which was comprised of HR positive patients who reccieved anti-hormone monotherapy, and HR positive patients who reccieved both anti-hormone and chemotherapy.
